### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, welcome to my GitHub for competitive programming!

Now that IOI is over, due to the numerous DMs I've been getting recently, I'm looking to expand my CP library, so if there are any suggestions regarding any problems you'd like me to add here, or any templates, or maybe something else, [please fill out this form!](https://forms.gle/fsZGtBWHtDAU1hZY6) You can also message me on Codeforces @ScarletS, or on Discord if you share servers with me!

# To-do List:

- Complete CSES (WIP)
- More templates
- Probably other things I can't remember now

If this helped you, please star!
